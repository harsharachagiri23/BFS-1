# Definition for a binary tree node.

                return
            if depth == len(res):
                res.append([])          # first time at this depth â†’ new level
            res[depth].append(node.val)
            dfs(node.left, depth + 1)

# Problem: Binary Tree Level Order Traversal (LeetCode 102)
# Approach: DFS with depth indexing (preorder), collecting values by level
# Time Complexity : O(N)
#     Each node is visited exactly once and appended to its level list.
# Space Complexity : O(H) auxiliary (call stack), where H is tree height; worst-case O(N) for a skewed tree.
#     Output storage is O(N) for all node values across levels.
# Did this code successfully run on LeetCode : Yes (102)
# Any problem you faced while coding this :
#    - Forgetting to create a new list when first reaching a depth (depth == len(res)).
#    - Returning [] instead of [] when root is None (handled here).
#    - Confusion about DFS vs BFS: DFS still works if we pass the current depth and bucket by depth.
